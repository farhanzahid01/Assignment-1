Assessment 2 of this unit requires you to write an SDD. This document should be at a detailed design
level. This means, all the major components of the system should be designed with a satisfactory level
of granularity such that if your SDD is given to a programmer to implement, it should be easily
implementable. In addition, the design should match the requirements specified during the
Requirement Analysis activity (see Section 2.1.2 Requirements Analysis in your A1 document). That is,
each design component should be indexed and should traceable to a requirement specification in
Section 2.1.2. You may use a matrix to manage this. Specifically, designs are required for: business
component identification, the front design end, process & workflow design, database design and
security concerns in design. You should use the Model View Controller (MVC) framework for the
server-side components of the process design.


1) Demonstrate skills in project planning and management, problem solving,
analysis, and evaluation.

2) Demonstrate skills in software design, development, implementation,
testing, and documentation of an authentic industry type project, that is, a less
well-structured or messy problem, requiring demonstration of high level skills.
